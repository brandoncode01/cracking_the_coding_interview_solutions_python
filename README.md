### About this repository

This repository contains the solutions of the cracking the coding interview book, solutions are written in 
Python and some of them contains more than one approach and a  Markdown detailed explanation.

The main purpose of this project is to help people to prepare for coding interviews. You must have medium-basic knowledge in Python, you can run and test the code locally in your computer or just see the solution to compare with yours.

### Technologies

The algorithms are coded in Python, this repository contains a requirements.txt to install all libraries

### Code Examples

Some code examples - questions have more than one solution I've coded some of the most common and some exercises contains a full detailed Markdown file that will explain the code more detailed

! Important: Some solution may vary from the Cracking The Coding Interview book mainly because solutions from Java to Python are different and some build ins and data structure are implemented different such as StringBuilder and Python Lists

The Project structure is divided into folders each folder is named as the name of the chapter and contains all exercises for example

- arrays_and_strings
- linked_lists

### Usage

As I already mention you can see this project as a guide or a point of comparison between your solutions or as a alternative to Java solutions from the book

### Requirements

- Python
